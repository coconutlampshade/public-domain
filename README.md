# Public Domain Image Search

A simple tool to search across multiple public domain and Creative Commons image collections simultaneously.

## What It Does

When a user enters a search term, this tool creates search links for 11 major institutional collections:

1. **Public Domain Image Archive** - General public domain images
2. **Smithsonian Open Access** - Over 3 million images from Smithsonian collections
3. **Artvee** - Classical artwork and vintage illustrations
4. **Metropolitan Museum of Art** - Public domain works from The Met
5. **Library of Congress** - Historical photographs and prints (in grid view)
6. **Getty** - Getty Museum and Research Institute collections
7. **Rijksmuseum** - Dutch art and historical objects
8. **Digital Commonwealth** - Creative Commons historical collections from Massachusetts
9. **NYPL Digital Collections** - New York Public Library digital collections
10. **Paris Museums** - Open access artworks from Paris museums
11. **National Gallery of Art** - Open access images from NGA collection

## How It Helps

Instead of visiting each site individually, users can enter one search term and quickly access results from all these collections. Each search opens in a new tab, allowing users to easily compare results across different institutions.

The tool is particularly useful for:
- Researchers looking for historical images
- Artists seeking public domain inspiration
- Educators searching for teaching materials
- Anyone needing freely usable images

## Usage

1. Enter your search term
2. Click search
3. Results will open in new tabs for each collection

## Note

Make sure your browser allows popups for this site to open multiple search results simultaneously.
